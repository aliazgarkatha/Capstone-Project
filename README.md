Wild Eye: Wildlife Detection on The Road
Wild Eye is an AI-powered system designed to enhance road safety by detecting wildlife on roads and issuing real-time warnings to drivers. This project aims to mitigate the risks associated with wildlife-related road accidents while also promoting wildlife conservation efforts.

Features-

1. Utilizes a custom CNN architecture, ResNet, for wildlife detection.

2. Analyze images and video footage to accurately identify animals.

3. Issues real-time warnings to drivers to enhance road safety for both humans and wildlife.

Our model achieved promising results with high accuracy in detecting wildlife on test images. For more details, refer to the project report.
